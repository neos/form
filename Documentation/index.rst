Forms
=====

The Form API is an extensible and flexible framework to **build web forms**.

It includes the following features:

* Ready-to-use standard form elements based on the `Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_
* Creation of **Multi-Step Forms**
* Server- and Client-Side **Validation**
* highly **flexible rendering** of form elements, based on Fluid
* **Extensible** with new form elements
* robust, **object oriented API**
* great integration into **TYPO3 Flow**

Furthermore, we built a **Form Builder** which is a web application for graphically
assembling and modifying forms, displayed below:
